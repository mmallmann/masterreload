dev tool for speed up dev cycle in Maya

link to the doc : http://giordi91.github.io/

Hi everyone. this is a tool I wrote out of frustration for the repetitive actions needed in order to develop in Maya. 
For example when you develop a C++ plug-in, you need to kill and re-open Maya when you recompile a new version, 
load the plugin/plugins and setup the scene over and over. That's why I decided to write this 
tool to speed up the process.

Here you can see how you can open the ui (PYTHON):

\code
import reload_master
from master_ui import sessionUi
reload(reload_master)
reload_master.reload_it()
s = sessionUi.SessionUi()
s.show()
\endcode


Here instead you can kick the default session (PYTHON):
\code
import reload_master
from master_ui import sessionUi
reload(reload_master)
reload_master.reload_it()
sessionUi.run_default()
\endcode

This two are actually the two script I use all the time, I attached them to two hotkeys:

ctrl + alt + w = show window 
ctrl + alt + q = kick default session

Here you can find a live demo of the tool
